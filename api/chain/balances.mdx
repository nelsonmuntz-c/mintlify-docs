# Balances

Query native token balances (`uxyz`) for any address, or check the total circulating supply on XYZ Chain.

## Get All Balances

Returns all native token balances for an address.

```bash
curl http://67.205.164.156:1317/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/balances/xyz1abc123...
```

<Accordion title="Response">
```json
{
  "balances": [
    {
      "denom": "uxyz",
      "amount": "5000000000"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "next_key": null,
    "total": "1"
  }
}
```

### Understanding Denominations

| Denomination | Meaning | Conversion |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| `uxyz` | Micro-XYZ (base unit) | 1 XYZ = 1,000,000 uxyz |

All amounts are returned in `uxyz`. To convert to human-readable XYZ, divide by 1,000,000.

```
5000000000 uxyz = 5,000 XYZ
```

## Get Balance for Specific Denom

Query balance for a single denomination (faster if you only need `uxyz`).

```bash
curl http://67.205.164.156:1317/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/balances/xyz1abc123.../by_denom?denom=uxyz
```

```json
{
  "balance": {
    "denom": "uxyz",
    "amount": "5000000000"
  }
}
```

## Get Spendable Balances

Returns balances that are available to spend (excludes locked, vesting, or delegated tokens).

```bash
curl http://67.205.164.156:1317/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/spendable_balances/xyz1abc123...
```

This is useful when you need to know how much a user can actually transfer or use for gas fees.

## Total Supply

Get the total supply of all denominations on the chain.

```bash
curl http://67.205.164.156:1317/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/supply
```

```json
{
  "supply": [
    {
      "denom": "uxyz",
      "amount": "150000000000000"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "next_key": null,
    "total": "1"
  }
}
```

### Supply of a Specific Denom

```bash
curl http://67.205.164.156:1317/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/supply/by_denom?denom=uxyz
```

```json
{
  "amount": {
    "denom": "uxyz",
    "amount": "150000000000000"
  }
}
```

<Note>
The total supply on XYZ Chain reflects only the tokens that have been bridged from Solana. Since the chain has zero inflation, supply only changes through bridge mint/burn operations.
