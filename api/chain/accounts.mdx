# Accounts

Every address on XYZ Chain has an associated account that tracks its sequence number (nonce), public key, and account number. These are needed for signing transactions.

## Get Account

Retrieve account details for an address.

```bash
curl http://67.205.164.156:1317/cosmos/auth/v1beta1/accounts/xyz1abc123...
```

<Accordion title="Response">
```json
{
  "account": {
    "@type": "/cosmos.auth.v1beta1.BaseAccount",
    "address": "xyz1abc123...",
    "pub_key": {
      "@type": "/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey",
      "key": "A1B2C3..."
    },
    "account_number": "42",
    "sequence": "15"
  }
}
```
</Accordion>

### Key Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `address` | The bech32-encoded address (prefix `xyz`) |
| `pub_key` | The public key, set after the account's first transaction |
| `account_number` | Unique identifier assigned when the account first receives funds. Used for transaction signing. |
| `sequence` | Transaction counter (nonce). Increments with each successful transaction. Used to prevent replay attacks. |

<Note>
`pub_key` is `null` for accounts that have received tokens but never sent a transaction. The public key is recorded on-chain with the first outgoing transaction.
</Note>

### Using Account Info for Signing

When building a transaction, you need `account_number` and `sequence` from this endpoint:

```typescript
const account = await fetch(
  'http://67.205.164.156:1317/cosmos/auth/v1beta1/accounts/xyz1...'
).then(r => r.json());

const signerInfo = {
  accountNumber: account.account.account_number,
  sequence: account.account.sequence,
};
```

If `sequence` is stale (another transaction was confirmed since your query), the transaction will fail with `code: 32` (account sequence mismatch). Re-query and retry.

## List All Accounts

Returns all accounts on the chain. Paginated.

```bash
curl "http://67.205.164.156:1317/cosmos/auth/v1beta1/accounts?pagination.limit=10"
```

<Warning>
This can return a large number of results on mainnet. Always use pagination parameters.
</Warning>

## Account Types

| `@type` | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/cosmos.auth.v1beta1.BaseAccount` | Standard user account |
| `/cosmos.auth.v1beta1.ModuleAccount` | System module account (e.g., bridge, distribution) |
| `/cosmos.vesting.v1beta1.ContinuousVestingAccount` | Account with vesting schedule |

Module accounts are system-owned and cannot be controlled by external keys. They appear in queries for the bridge module, fee pool, and other on-chain mechanisms.
