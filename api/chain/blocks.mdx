# Blocks

Retrieve block headers, transaction lists, and consensus metadata for any block on XYZ Chain.

## Get Latest Block

Returns the most recently finalized block.

```bash
curl http://67.205.164.156:1317/cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/blocks/latest
```

<Accordion title="Response">
```json
{
  "block_id": {
    "hash": "A1B2C3D4...",
    "part_set_header": {
      "total": 1,
      "hash": "E5F6G7H8..."
    }
  },
  "block": {
    "header": {
      "chain_id": "xyz-1",
      "height": "152340",
      "time": "2026-02-19T10:00:00.000Z",
      "proposer_address": "ABC123..."
    },
    "data": {
      "txs": ["base64-encoded-tx-1", "base64-encoded-tx-2"]
    },
    "last_commit": {
      "height": "152339",
      "signatures": [...]
    }
  }
}
```
</Accordion>

### Key Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `block.header.chain_id` | Chain identifier (`xyz-1` for mainnet) |
| `block.header.height` | Block number as a string |
| `block.header.time` | Block timestamp in RFC 3339 format |
| `block.header.proposer_address` | Hex-encoded address of the validator that proposed this block |
| `block.data.txs` | Array of base64-encoded transactions included in this block |
| `block.last_commit.signatures` | Validator signatures from the previous block's commit |

## Get Block by Height

Retrieve a specific block by its height.

```bash
curl http://67.205.164.156:1317/cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/blocks/152340
```

The response format is identical to the latest block endpoint.

### Errors

| Case | Response |
|------|----------|
| Height not yet reached | `400` — block height is ahead of the chain |
| Height = 0 | `400` — invalid height |
| Negative height | `400` — invalid argument |

## Useful Patterns

### Check Current Block Height

```bash
curl -s http://67.205.164.156:1317/cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/blocks/latest \
  | jq '.block.header.height'
```

### Get Block Timestamp

```bash
curl -s http://67.205.164.156:1317/cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/blocks/152340 \
  | jq '.block.header.time'
```

### Count Transactions in a Block

```bash
curl -s http://67.205.164.156:1317/cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/blocks/152340 \
  | jq '.block.data.txs | length'
```
