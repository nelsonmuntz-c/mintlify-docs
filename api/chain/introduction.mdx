# Chain API

The Chain API provides standard Cosmos SDK REST endpoints for querying blockchain state — blocks, transactions, accounts, balances, validators, and token metadata.

## Base URL

```
http://67.205.164.156:1317
```

This is the Cosmos SDK LCD (Light Client Daemon) REST interface running on the primary validator node. All endpoints return JSON.

## Authentication

All read endpoints are public. No API key or authentication is required for queries.

Transactions must be signed client-side before broadcasting. See the [SDK docs](/sdk/overview) for signing helpers.

## Rate Limits

| Endpoint Type | Limit |
|---------------|-------|
| Read queries | 100 requests/min per IP |
| Transaction broadcast | 10 requests/min per IP |

For higher throughput, run your own node.

## Common Patterns

### Pagination

Most list endpoints support cursor-based pagination:

```bash
# First page (10 results)
curl "http://67.205.164.156:1317/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/balances/xyz1...?pagination.limit=10"

# Next page (pass next_key from previous response)
curl "http://67.205.164.156:1317/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/balances/xyz1...?pagination.key=ABC123&pagination.limit=10"

# Include total count
curl "http://67.205.164.156:1317/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/balances/xyz1...?pagination.count_total=true"
```

### Error Responses

Errors return a standard structure:

```json
{
  "code": 5,
  "message": "rpc error: code = NotFound desc = account xyz1... not found",
  "details": []
}
```

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 2 | Unknown error |
| 3 | Invalid argument |
| 5 | Not found |
| 11 | Out of range |

## Available Endpoints

| Section | What You Can Query |

| [Blocks](/api/chain/blocks) | Latest block, block by height |
| [Transactions](/api/chain/transactions) | Tx by hash, search by sender/recipient/height |
| [Accounts](/api/chain/accounts) | Account info, sequence number, public key |
| [Balances](/api/chain/balances) | Native token balances, total supply |
| [Validators](/api/chain/validators) | Validator set, delegations, staking pool |
| [Network](/api/chain/network) | Node info, syncing status |
