# List Tokens

Returns all tokens that have been created on the Launchpad or indexed from AMM trading. Each token includes its current price, XYZ reserves, 24-hour volume, and graduation status.

## Endpoint

```
GET /api/tokens
```

## Request

No parameters required.

```bash
curl http://67.205.164.156:3001/api/tokens
```

## Response

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `address` | string | CW20 contract address of the token |
| `name` | string \| null | Token name (set at creation) |
| `symbol` | string \| null | Token ticker symbol |
| `image` | string \| null | Token image URL |
| `description` | string \| null | Token description |
| `creator` | string \| null | Address that created the token |
| `source` | string | Where the token originated: `"launchpad"` or `"amm"` |
| `graduated` | boolean | `true` if the token has graduated from bonding curve to AMM |
| `xyz_reserves` | string | Current XYZ reserves in `uxyz`. For bonding curve tokens, this is the curve's reserve. For graduated tokens, this reflects the last known AMM pool reserve. |
| `current_price` | string | Latest trade price in `uxyz` per token, scaled by 10^6. Divide by 10^6 to get price in `uxyz`. |
| `volume_24h` | string | Total trading volume in `uxyz` over the last 24 hours |
| `trade_count_24h` | number | Number of trades in the last 24 hours |
| `created_at` | string \| null | Token creation timestamp (from on-chain event) |
| `first_seen_at` | string | When the indexer first observed this token |

### Understanding Prices

Prices are stored as integers scaled by 10^6 to avoid floating-point precision issues:

```
current_price = "52000"  →  52000 / 10^6 = 0.052 uxyz per micro-token
                         →  0.052 XYZ per token (since both have 6 decimals)
```

### Understanding Reserves

For tokens still on the bonding curve, `xyz_reserves` indicates how close the token is to graduation:

```
Graduation threshold is dynamic per token (computed from oracle XYZ/USD price).
Query the launchpad contract's "progress" endpoint for exact threshold.
Current reserves:  3200000000000 uxyz
Progress: reserves / threshold = percentage toward graduation
```

## Ordering

Tokens are returned ordered by `first_seen_at` descending (newest first).
