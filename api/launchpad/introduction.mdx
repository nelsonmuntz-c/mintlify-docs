# Launchpad API

The Launchpad API is a backend service that indexes blockchain events from the Launchpad and AMM contracts into a TimescaleDB database. It provides fast, pre-formatted REST endpoints and real-time Server-Sent Events (SSE) for frontends and bots.

## Base URL

```
http://67.205.164.156:3001
```

## Why Use This Instead of Chain API?

The Chain API (port 1317) gives you raw blockchain state. The Launchpad API gives you **pre-indexed, enriched data** that's ready to display:

| Need | Chain API | Launchpad API |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| List all tokens with prices | Query each contract individually | `GET /api/tokens` — one call |
| Trade history for a token | Search events, parse wasm logs | `GET /api/trades/recent?token_address=...` |
| OHLCV candlestick charts | Not available | `GET /api/candles/:address` |
| Real-time trade feed | WebSocket + event parsing | `GET /api/sse/feed` — ready-to-use events |
| Token 24h volume | Aggregate from raw trades | Pre-computed in token response |

## Authentication

All endpoints are public. No API key required.

## Rate Limits

| Window | Max Requests |
|--------|-------------|
| 60 seconds | 100 per IP |

Rate limit headers are included in responses:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1708300000
```

## Health Check

```bash
curl http://67.205.164.156:3001/api/health
```

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-19T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Available Endpoints

| Section | Endpoints |
|---------|-----------|
| [List Tokens](/api/launchpad/list-tokens) | All indexed tokens with metadata, prices, and 24h stats |
| [Token Detail](/api/launchpad/token-detail) | Single token by contract address |
| [Trades](/api/launchpad/trades) | Recent trades, filterable by token |
| [Candles](/api/launchpad/candles) | OHLCV candlestick data (1m, 5m, 1h, 1d) |
| [SSE Feed](/api/launchpad/sse) | Real-time trade, launch, and graduation events |
| [Wallet](/api/launchpad/wallet) | Balance, token holdings, transaction history, and broadcast |

## Data Sources

The API indexes events from two on-chain contracts:

| Source | Contract | Events Indexed |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Launchpad | Bonding curve contract | `token_created`, `buy`, `sell`, `buy_and_graduate`, `graduate` |
| AMM | Constant-product DEX | `swap` (both directions) |

The indexer polls the chain every ~5 seconds and writes all events atomically to the database. OHLCV candles are computed automatically by TimescaleDB continuous aggregates at 1-minute, 5-minute, 1-hour, and 1-day intervals.
