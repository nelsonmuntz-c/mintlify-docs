## Errors

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| `404` | Token not found — either the address is wrong or the token hasn't been indexed yet |
| `500` | Internal server error |

### 404 Response

```json
{
  "error": "Token not found"
}
```

<Note>
Tokens appear in the index within ~5 seconds of their first on-chain trade or creation event. If you've just created a token and get a 404, wait a few seconds and retry.
</Note>

## Using Token Detail for Trading UI

A typical trading UI needs to display:

1. **Token identity** — `name`, `symbol`, `image`
2. **Current price** — `current_price` (divide by 10^6 for human-readable)
3. **Graduation status** — `graduated` determines whether to route trades to the Launchpad (bonding curve) or AMM
4. **Liquidity depth** — `xyz_reserves` indicates how much XYZ is backing this token
5. **Activity** — `volume_24h` and `trade_count_24h` show how actively it's being traded

### Example: Display Price in XYZ

```typescript
const token = await fetch('http://67.205.164.156:3001/api/tokens/xyz1...')
  .then(r => r.json());

const priceInXyz = Number(token.current_price) / 1e6;
console.log(`${token.symbol}: ${priceInXyz} XYZ`);
// "EXT: 0.052 XYZ"
```
