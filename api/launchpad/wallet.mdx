# Wallet Endpoints

Convenience endpoints for wallet applications — query native balances, CW20 token holdings, transaction history, and broadcast signed transactions through the backend.

## Get Native Balance

Returns the `uxyz` balance for an address.

```
GET /api/wallet/balance?address=xyz1useraddress...
```

```json
{
  "address": "xyz1useraddress...",
  "balance": "5000000000"
}
```

The balance is in `uxyz`. Divide by 1,000,000 for XYZ.

## Get Token Holdings

Returns all CW20 token balances for an address by querying each known token contract.

```
GET /api/wallet/tokens?address=xyz1useraddress...
```

```json
{
  "address": "xyz1useraddress...",
  "tokens": [
    {
      "address": "xyz1tokencontract...",
      "name": "Example Token",
      "symbol": "EXT",
      "balance": "50000000000",
      "price_uxyz": "52000",
      "graduated": true
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `balance` | Token balance in micro-units |
| `price_uxyz` | Current token price (uxyz per token, scaled by 10^6) |
| `graduated` | Whether the token has moved to AMM trading |

## Get Transaction History

Returns transactions for an address, ordered by most recent first.

```
GET /api/wallet/transactions?address=xyz1useraddress...
```

Query Parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `address` | string | required | XYZ Chain address |
| `limit` | number | 20 | Max results (1-100) |
| `page` | number | 1 | Page number |

## Get Prices

Returns the current XYZ/USD price fetched from pump.fun.

```
GET /api/wallet/prices
```

```json
{
  "XYZ": 0.00042
}
```

The price is cached for 5 minutes. Returns `{ "XYZ": 0 }` if the price feed is unavailable.

## Broadcast Transaction

Submit a signed transaction through the backend node. The backend relays it to the chain and returns the result.

```
POST /api/wallet/broadcast
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "tx_bytes": "base64-encoded-signed-transaction"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "tx_hash": "A1B2C3D4E5F6...",
  "code": 0,
  "raw_log": ""
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `tx_hash` | Transaction hash (use to query status later) |
| `code` | `0` = success, non-zero = error |
| `raw_log` | Error details if `code` is non-zero |

<Note>
The broadcast endpoint includes deduplication — submitting the same signed transaction twice will return the hash from the first submission rather than broadcasting again.
</Note>

### Error Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 4 | Unauthorized (wrong signer) |
| 5 | Insufficient funds |
| 11 | Out of gas |
| 32 | Account sequence mismatch (re-query account and retry) |
