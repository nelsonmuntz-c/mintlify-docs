# SSE Feed

Subscribe to a real-time stream of events from the Launchpad and AMM. The SSE (Server-Sent Events) feed pushes trades, new token launches, and graduation events as they happen — no polling required.

## Endpoint

```
GET /api/sse/feed
```

This is a long-lived HTTP connection that streams events using the [SSE protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).

```bash
curl -N http://67.205.164.156:3001/api/sse/feed
```

## Event Types

### `trade`

Fired for every buy, sell, or swap across all tokens.

```
event: trade
data: {
  "token_address": "xyz1cw20contract...",
  "action": "swap",
  "direction": "xyz_to_token",
  "input_amount": "100000000",
  "output_amount": "1923076923",
  "price_uxyz": "52000",
  "trader": "xyz1useraddress...",
  "tx_hash": "A1B2C3D4...",
  "time": "2026-02-19T10:05:30.000Z",
  "xyz_reserves": "5200000000000"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `action` | `"buy"`, `"sell"`, `"swap"`, or `"buy_and_graduate"` |
| `direction` | `"xyz_to_token"` (buy) or `"token_to_xyz"` (sell) |
| `input_amount` | Amount sent by the trader (uxyz for buys, micro-tokens for sells) |
| `output_amount` | Amount received by the trader |
| `price_uxyz` | Trade price (uxyz per token, scaled by 10^6) |
| `xyz_reserves` | Updated XYZ reserves for this token **after** the trade |

### `token_launch`

Fired when a new token is created on the Launchpad.

```
event: token_launch
data: {
  "token_address": "xyz1newtoken...",
  "creator": "xyz1creatoraddress...",
  "initial_reserves": "80000000000",
  "time": "2026-02-19T10:10:00.000Z"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `token_address` | CW20 contract address of the newly created token |
| `creator` | Address that paid the creation fee |
| `initial_reserves` | Starting XYZ reserves (from the creation fee) in `uxyz` |

### `graduation`

Fired when a bonding curve token graduates to the AMM.

```
event: graduation
data: {
  "token_address": "xyz1graduatedtoken...",
  "xyz_for_pool": "5000000000000",
  "tokens_for_pool": "20690000000000",
  "creator": "xyz1creatoraddress...",
  "time": "2026-02-19T10:15:00.000Z"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `xyz_for_pool` | XYZ transferred to the AMM pool (in `uxyz`) |
| `tokens_for_pool` | Tokens transferred to the AMM pool (in micro-units) |
| `creator` | Original token creator |

## JavaScript Client

```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource('http://67.205.164.156:3001/api/sse/feed');

eventSource.addEventListener('trade', (event) => {
  const trade = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log(`${trade.direction} on ${trade.token_address}: ${trade.input_amount} → ${trade.output_amount}`);
});

eventSource.addEventListener('token_launch', (event) => {
  const launch = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log(`New token launched: ${launch.token_address} by ${launch.creator}`);
});

eventSource.addEventListener('graduation', (event) => {
  const grad = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log(`Token graduated to AMM: ${grad.token_address}`);
});

eventSource.onerror = () => {
  console.log('SSE connection lost, reconnecting...');
  // EventSource auto-reconnects by default
};
```

## Connection Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Protocol | HTTP/1.1 SSE |
| Keepalive | Comment sent every 15 seconds |
| Auto-reconnect | Built into the SSE spec — browsers reconnect automatically |
| Latency | ~5 seconds from on-chain event to SSE broadcast |

<Note>
The SSE feed broadcasts **all** events across all tokens. Filter client-side by `token_address` if you only care about specific tokens.
