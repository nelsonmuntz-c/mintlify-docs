# Searching the Explorer

The XYZ Chain Explorer supports searching by several identifiers. Each search type takes you to the appropriate detail page.

## Search by Transaction Hash

Find any transaction using its hash (64 hexadecimal characters):

```
Example: A1B2C3D4E5F6...  (64 hex characters)
```

The transaction page shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| TX Hash | The unique transaction identifier |
| Status | Success or failed (with error message) |
| Block Height | Which block included this transaction (linked) |
| Gas Used / Wanted | Gas consumed vs. gas limit |
| Fee | Transaction fee paid |
| Messages | All messages in the transaction with decoded parameters |

<Tip>
You can copy a TX hash from your wallet's transaction history or from the bridge status tracker after a deposit or withdrawal.
</Tip>

## Search by Address

Look up any XYZ Chain address (starts with `xyz1`) to view:

- **Balances** -- Native XYZ and all CW20 token holdings
- **Delegations** -- Staking positions with each validator
- **Rewards** -- Unclaimed staking rewards
- **Unbonding** -- Active unbonding with countdown timers
- **Transaction History** -- All sent and received transactions
- **Bridge Data** -- Burn records for bridge users

### Validator Addresses

Validator addresses start with `xyzvaloper1` and show:

- Validator details (moniker, commission, description)
- Voting power and delegator count
- Performance metrics

## Search by Block Height

Enter a block number to view:

- Block timestamp and proposer
- All transactions in that block
- Gas usage summary

### Future Block Estimation

The explorer can estimate when a future block will be produced. Enter a block height that hasn't occurred yet to see a countdown based on the average block time (~6 seconds).

## Search by Contract Address

Enter a CosmWasm contract address to view:

- Contract label and code ID
- Creator address
- Transaction history involving this contract
- Other contracts deployed from the same code ID

You can also browse all contracts by navigating to the **Smart Contracts** section and searching by:

- **Contract address** -- Finds a specific contract
- **Creator address** -- Shows all contracts deployed by that address

## Search by Code ID

In the Smart Contracts section, browse by code ID to see:

- Upload hash and creator
- Instantiation permissions
- All contracts deployed from this code

## Quick Navigation

| You Have | Where to Go |

| `xyz1...` address | Accounts section, paste address |
