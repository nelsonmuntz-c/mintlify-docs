# Deposit: Solana to XYZ Chain

Depositing transfers your XYZ tokens from Solana into XYZ Chain. Your tokens are locked in the bridge pool vault on Solana, and an equivalent amount is minted on XYZ Chain.

## Prerequisites

- A Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.) with XYZ tokens
- An XYZ Chain wallet (Keplr, Leap, or XYZ Wallet)
- A small amount of SOL for Solana transaction fees

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>

### Connect your Solana wallet

Click the **Connect Solana** button at the top of the Bridge page. Select your preferred Solana wallet from the dropdown. Your XYZ token balance will appear once connected.

### Register your XYZ Chain address (first time only)

If this is your first time using the bridge, you need to link your Solana wallet to an XYZ Chain address. You can either:

- **Connect a wallet** -- Click "Connect XYZ Wallet" and select Keplr, Leap, or XYZ Wallet to auto-fill your address
- **Enter manually** -- Type your XYZ Chain address (starts with `xyz1`, 39+ characters)

Click **Register Address** to create the on-chain link. This is a one-time step per wallet pair.

<Note>
Each Solana wallet can only be linked to one XYZ Chain address. You cannot change this mapping after registration.
</Note>

### Enter the deposit amount

Type the amount of XYZ you want to bridge. The UI shows your available Solana balance and the minimum deposit requirement.

Click **Max** to fill your full available balance (minus a small buffer for gas fees).

### Confirm the transaction

Click **Deposit** and approve the transaction in your Solana wallet. The UI will show:

1. **Approving Transaction...** -- Waiting for your wallet signature
2. **Confirming on Solana...** -- Waiting for Solana network confirmation

### Track your deposit

After confirmation, the **Deposit Status Tracker** appears with your Solana transaction signature. The relayer detects your deposit, waits for finality (32 slots, ~15 seconds), and mints tokens on XYZ Chain.

</Steps>

## Processing Time

| Step | Duration |
|------|----------|
| Solana confirmation | ~5 seconds |
| Finality wait (32 slots) | ~15 seconds |
| Relayer detection + mint | ~5-10 seconds |
| **Total** | **~30 seconds** |

## What Happens Under the Hood

```
1. Your XYZ tokens transfer from your wallet → pool vault on Solana
2. The bridge program emits a DepositEvent
3. The relayer's PoolMonitor detects the event
4. After 32-slot finality, the relayer's XyzExecutor mints tokens on XYZ Chain
5. Minted tokens appear in your registered XYZ Chain address
```

<Warning>
Only deposit amounts above the minimum (currently 1 XYZ). Deposits below the minimum will be rejected by the bridge program.
