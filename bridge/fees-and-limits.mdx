# Fees & Limits

The XYZ Bridge has no bridging fees -- you receive the exact amount you deposit or withdraw. However, you pay standard gas fees on each chain, and rate limits apply to withdrawals.

## Bridging Fees

| Fee Type | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Bridge fee | **None** (0%) |
| Deposit fee | **None** |
| Withdrawal fee | **None** |

You receive exactly the amount you bridge, minus only the gas fees for the transactions on each chain.

## Gas Requirements

You need gas tokens on each chain to execute bridge transactions.

### Deposit (Solana to XYZ Chain)

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| SOL for Solana tx | ~0.000005 SOL per transaction (standard Solana fee) |
| Account creation | ~0.002 SOL for first-time registration (rent-exempt UserAccount PDA) |

### Withdraw (XYZ Chain to Solana)

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| XYZ for chain tx | ~0.01 XYZ for the burn transaction on XYZ Chain |
| SOL for Solana tx | Paid by the relayer (no cost to user) |

<Tip>
The withdrawal UI automatically reserves ~0.01 XYZ from your max balance for gas fees when you click "Max".
</Tip>

## Minimum Amounts

| Direction | Minimum |
|-----------|---------|
| Deposit | 1 XYZ |
| Withdrawal | No minimum (but consider gas costs) |

The minimum deposit is configurable by the bridge admin and exists to prevent dust attacks on the pool vault.

## Rate Limits (Withdrawals)

Withdrawals are subject to governance-controlled rate limits to prevent abuse:

| Parameter | Value | Controlled By |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| `max_burn_per_tx` | 1,000,000 XYZ (1M) | Governance proposal |
| `max_burns_per_block` | 10 burns per block | Governance proposal |

### What This Means

- A single withdrawal transaction can move up to **1 million XYZ**
- A maximum of **10 withdrawal transactions** can be included in a single block (~6 second block time)
- For amounts above 1M XYZ, split into multiple transactions

<Note>
Deposits have no rate limits. You can deposit any amount in a single transaction.
</Note>

## Processing Time

| Step | Typical Duration |
|------|-----------------|
| Deposit (Solana to XYZ Chain) | ~30 seconds |
| Withdrawal (XYZ Chain to Solana) | ~20-30 seconds |

Processing time includes network confirmation, finality waiting (32 slots for deposits), and relayer execution.
