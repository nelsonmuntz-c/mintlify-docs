# Bridge FAQ

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How long does a bridge transfer take?">
Both deposits and withdrawals typically complete within **30 seconds**:

- **Deposit**: ~5s Solana confirmation + ~15s finality wait + ~10s relayer processing
- **Withdrawal**: ~6s XYZ Chain block + ~10s relayer detection + ~5s Solana execution
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My deposit hasn't appeared on XYZ Chain. What should I do?">
Wait at least 2 minutes. The relayer waits for 32-slot finality on Solana (~15 seconds) before processing. If your tokens still haven't appeared:

1. Verify your Solana transaction was confirmed (check your wallet or a Solana explorer)
2. Confirm your XYZ Chain address was registered before depositing
3. Check the correct XYZ Chain address -- the bridge mints to the address linked during registration

If the issue persists, contact support in the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/xyz).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My withdrawal is stuck. What should I do?">
Withdrawals can take up to 30 seconds. If your tokens haven't arrived on Solana:

1. Confirm the burn transaction was successful on XYZ Chain (check the Explorer)
2. Verify the Solana address you entered is correct
3. Wait a few minutes -- the relayer may be processing a queue

If the withdrawal fails on the Solana side, the relayer flags it for manual intervention. Your burned tokens on XYZ Chain are recorded and will be fulfilled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to register my address every time?">
No. Registration is a **one-time step** per Solana wallet. Once you link your Solana wallet to an XYZ Chain address, all future deposits from that wallet are automatically routed to the same XYZ Chain address.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I change my registered XYZ Chain address?">
No. Each Solana wallet can only be linked to **one XYZ Chain address**. This is enforced by the on-chain UserAccount PDA. If you need to bridge to a different XYZ Chain address, use a different Solana wallet.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is there a minimum deposit?">
Yes. The minimum deposit is **1 XYZ**. This prevents dust attacks on the pool vault. Deposits below the minimum are rejected by the bridge program.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is there a maximum transfer amount?">
- **Deposits**: No maximum. You can deposit any amount in a single transaction.
- **Withdrawals**: Maximum **1,000,000 XYZ** per transaction. For larger amounts, split into multiple transactions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there any bridging fees?">
No. The bridge charges **zero fees**. You receive the exact amount you deposit or withdraw. You only pay standard gas fees on each chain (SOL for Solana transactions, XYZ for XYZ Chain transactions).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I bridge staking rewards back to Solana?">
No. Only bridge-minted tokens (tokens that came in via deposit) can be withdrawn. Native staking rewards earned on XYZ Chain are XYZ Chain-native and cannot cross back to Solana through the bridge.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which wallets are supported?">
| Chain | Supported Wallets |
|-------|-------------------|
| Solana | Phantom, Solflare, and other Solana Wallet Adapter-compatible wallets |
| XYZ Chain | Keplr, Leap, XYZ Wallet |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if the relayer goes down?">
No funds are lost. The relayer tracks its processing state in a database:

- **Deposits**: When the relayer comes back online, it resumes from the last processed Solana signature
- **Withdrawals**: It resumes from the last processed XYZ Chain block height

All pending transfers are completed once the relayer recovers.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is the bridge audited?">
The bridge uses several security measures:

- **Pool custody** -- All tokens are held in an auditable on-chain vault (not a centralized wallet)
- **Supply conservation** -- The total supply across Solana + pool + XYZ Chain always equals 1 billion
- **Rate limiting** -- Governance-controlled limits prevent abuse
- **User-signed burns** -- The relayer cannot initiate withdrawals; only users can burn their own tokens
