# Telegram Bot

The XYZ Telegram Bot lets you trade tokens, check balances, and manage your wallet without leaving Telegram. It creates a non-custodial wallet for you and provides instant access to the XYZ Chain ecosystem.

## Getting Started

<Steps>

### Start the bot

Open the XYZ Trading Bot in Telegram and send `/start`. The bot creates a new XYZ Chain wallet for you automatically.

### Fund your wallet

Send XYZ tokens to your bot wallet address. You can bridge tokens from Solana using the [XYZ Bridge](/bridge/overview) or receive from another XYZ Chain wallet.

### Start trading

Use the interactive menu buttons or paste a token contract address to start trading instantly.

## Main Menu

After running `/start`, the bot displays an interactive menu with buttons for:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Buy** | Buy tokens by entering a contract address and amount |
| **Sell** | Sell tokens from your portfolio |
| **Positions** | View your open token positions |
| **Limit Orders** | Create and manage limit orders |
| **Wallet** | View address, balance, send tokens |
| **Settings** | Configure slippage, notifications, etc. |
| **Referral** | View your referral link and earnings |

## Quick Trade

The fastest way to trade: simply **paste a token contract address** into the chat. The bot recognizes it and shows a trading interface for that token with buy/sell options.

## Security

- **Non-custodial** -- Your wallet keys are encrypted and stored securely
- **Private chats only** -- The bot operates exclusively in private messages
- **Auto-delete** -- Sensitive messages (like exported mnemonics) auto-delete after 30 seconds
- **Import/Export** -- Bring your own wallet or export to use elsewhere

<Warning>
Your bot wallet is separate from your browser wallet. Fund it independently. Never share your exported mnemonic with anyone.
