# Quickstart

This guide will walk you through setting up your development environment, generating keys, and deploying your first smart contract.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Go 1.24+** - [Download](https://go.dev/dl/)
- **Docker** - For contract builds (optional but recommended)
- **Rust** - For contract development (optional)

## Step 1: Install the CLI

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/xyzchainorg/xyz
cd xyz

# Install both binaries
make install        # Installs xyzd (chain daemon)
make install-cli    # Installs xyz (developer CLI)
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
xyz --version
# xyz version 2.0.0

xyzd version
# xyzd version 2.0.0
```

## Step 2: Generate a Keypair

Create your first keypair to interact with the chain:

```bash
xyz keys generate mykey
```

<Accordion title="Example Output">
```
Generated new keypair: mykey

Address: xyz1abc123def456...
Mnemonic (save this securely):
abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about

WARNING: Write down your mnemonic phrase and store it securely.
This is the only way to recover your account.
```
</Accordion>

<Warning>
**Save your mnemonic phrase!** This is the only way to recover your account. Never share it with anyone.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Start Local Development Network

Launch a local testnet with pre-funded accounts:

```bash
xyz localnet start
```

<Accordion title="Example Output">
```
Starting local XYZ Chain...

Chain ID:    xyz-1
RPC:         http://localhost:26657
REST:        http://localhost:1317
gRPC:        localhost:9090

Test Accounts:
  alice: xyz1... (1,000,000 XYZ)
  bob:   xyz1... (500,000 XYZ)

Local network started successfully!
```
</Accordion>

The localnet provides two pre-funded test accounts:

| Account | Balance | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `alice` | 1,000,000 XYZ | Development, deployment |
| `bob` | 500,000 XYZ | Testing transfers |

## Step 4: Check Your Balance

Query the balance of the test account:

```bash
xyz balance --key alice
```

```
Address: xyz1...
Balance: 1,000,000,000,000 uxyz (1,000,000 XYZ)
```

## Step 5: Deploy Your First Contract

### 5a. Scaffold a New Project

```bash
xyz init my-token
cd my-token
```

This creates a complete CosmWasm project:

```
my-token/
├── Cargo.toml
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs
│   ├── contract.rs
│   ├── msg.rs
│   ├── state.rs
│   └── error.rs
└── README.md
```

### 5b. Build the Contract

```bash
xyz program build
```

This uses Docker to create an optimized `.wasm` file:

```
Building contract with cosmwasm/optimizer:0.16.0...
Optimized wasm: artifacts/my_token.wasm (180KB)
```

### 5c. Deploy to Local Network

```bash
xyz program deploy artifacts/my_token.wasm \
  --from alice \
  --label "My First Token"
```

```
Contract Deployed Successfully!

Code ID:   1
Contract:  xyz1contract...
Label:     My First Token
TxHash:    ABC123...
Gas Used:  234567
```

## Step 6: Interact with Your Contract

### Query Contract State

```bash
xyz program query xyz1contract... '{"token_info":{}}'
```

```json
{
  "name": "My Token",
  "symbol": "MTK",
  "decimals": 6,
  "total_supply": "1000000000000"
}
```

### Execute Contract Method

```bash
xyz program execute xyz1contract... \
  '{"transfer":{"recipient":"xyz1bob...","amount":"1000000"}}' \
  --from alice
```

```
Transaction successful!
TxHash: DEF456...
```

## Step 7: Clean Up

When you're done, stop the local network:

```bash
xyz localnet stop
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Port 26657 already in use">
    Another process is using the RPC port. Stop any running chain instances:
    ```bash
    xyz localnet stop
    # or
    pkill xyzd
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Docker not found (during build)">
    Install Docker or use local Rust build:
    ```bash
    xyz program build --local
    ```
    Note: Local builds require Rust with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Insufficient funds error">
    Make sure you're using a funded test account:
    ```bash
    xyz balance --key alice
    ```
    If balance is zero, restart the localnet with `--reset`:
    ```bash
    xyz localnet start --reset
    ```
