# Graduation

Graduation is the process of migrating a token from its bonding curve to the [AMM](/amm/overview). This happens automatically when the curve accumulates enough XYZ reserves, creating a deep liquidity pool for open market trading.

## Graduation Threshold

A token graduates when its bonding curve reaches its **dynamic XYZ threshold** in reserves. The threshold is computed from the oracle XYZ/USD price and configured USD targets (e.g., ~$2,000 raised), and can only ratchet upward as the oracle price changes.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Bonding Curve                                       │
│  ████████████████████████████░░░░░░░  75% to grad   │
│  XYZ reserves: 75% of threshold                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

You can check any token's progress toward graduation:

```json
{ "progress": { "token_address": "<cw20_token_address>" } }
```

Returns `progress_percent`, `xyz_raised`, and `graduation_threshold`.

## How Graduation Works

<Steps>

### Threshold is reached

A buy transaction pushes the curve's XYZ reserves to or above the graduation threshold. Graduation triggers automatically as part of that buy transaction.

### Curve closes permanently

The bonding curve is marked as `graduated`. No more buys or sells can happen on the curve.

### Liquidity migrates to AMM

All remaining assets move to a new AMM pool:
- **XYZ reserves** -- All XYZ locked in the curve becomes the XYZ side of the pool
- **Unsold tokens** -- All tokens still held by the launchpad become the token side of the pool

### AMM pool opens for trading

A new constant-product AMM pool is created with the migrated liquidity. Trading continues on the AMM with `x*y=k` mechanics.

</Steps>

## What Changes After Graduation

| Aspect | Before (Bonding Curve) | After (AMM) |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| Price model | Linear curve | Constant product (x*y=k) |
| Liquidity | Guaranteed by curve formula | Pool-based, deeper with more volume |
| Buy fee | 0.5% | 1% swap fee |
| Sell fee | 2.5% (to LP) | 1% swap fee |
| Price direction | Always up with buys | Market-driven (can go up or down) |

## Manual Graduation

Graduation usually happens automatically during a buy. However, if a token has reached the threshold but hasn't graduated (edge case), anyone can trigger it manually:

```json
{
  "graduate": {
    "token_address": "<cw20_token_address>"
  }
}
```

This is permissionless -- no funds required, anyone can call it.

## Post-Graduation Trading

After graduation, use the AMM to trade:

- **Buy tokens**: Swap XYZ for tokens on the [AMM](/amm/swapping)
- **Sell tokens**: Swap tokens for XYZ on the [AMM](/amm/swapping)
- **Check price**: Query the AMM [pool](/amm/overview) for current reserves and price

<Note>
The AMM may charge an **augmented fee** (up to 5%) on top of the base 1% swap fee for newly graduated pools. This extra fee auto-disables once the pool reaches a target value, ensuring fair price discovery during the transition period.
