# Create a Token

Anyone can create a new token on the XYZ Launchpad by paying the creation fee. Your token launches with a bonding curve and is immediately tradeable.

## Prerequisites

- An XYZ Chain wallet (Keplr, Leap, or XYZ Wallet)
- At least **80,000 XYZ** for the creation fee (check the current fee in the launchpad UI)

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>

### Connect your wallet

Click **Connect Wallet** on the Launchpad page. Select Keplr, Leap, or XYZ Wallet. Ensure your wallet has enough XYZ to cover the creation fee.

### Fill in token details

Provide the following information:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Name | The full name of your token | "My Cool Token" |
| Symbol | A short ticker (typically 3-6 characters) | "COOL" |
| Image | URL to your token's logo | `https://example.com/logo.png` |
| Description | A brief description of your token | "The coolest token on XYZ Chain" |
| Social Links | Optional links to Twitter, website, etc. | `https://twitter.com/cooltoken` |

### Confirm and pay the creation fee

Review your token details and click **Create Token**. Your wallet will prompt you to approve a transaction that includes the creation fee.

### Your token is live

Once confirmed, your token is immediately available on the launchpad with a bonding curve. The creation fee becomes the initial XYZ reserves in the curve.

</Steps>

## What Happens on Creation

When you create a token, the launchpad contract:

1. Collects the creation fee as initial XYZ reserves for the curve
2. Instantiates a new CW20 token contract with **100,000,000 token supply** (6 decimals)
3. Holds all tokens in the launchpad contract (released via buys)
4. Creates and indexes a bonding curve for the new token

## Contract Message

For developers integrating directly, the create token message is:

```json
{
  "create_token": {
    "name": "My Cool Token",
    "symbol": "COOL",
    "image": "https://example.com/logo.png",
    "description": "The coolest token on XYZ Chain",
    "social_links": ["https://twitter.com/cooltoken"]
  }
}
```

**Funds required**: `[{ "denom": "uxyz", "amount": "<creation_fee_in_uxyz>" }]`

<Tip>
Query the launchpad contract's `Config` endpoint to get the current creation fee:
```json
{ "config": {} }
```
The `creation_fee` field returns the fee in uxyz (e.g., `"80000000000"` = 80,000 XYZ).
</Tip>

## Token Name & Symbol Cooldown

To prevent rapid spam and name squatting, the launchpad enforces an **8-hour cooldown** on token names and symbols. If someone creates a token named "DOGE", no one else can create another token with that same name or symbol for 8 hours. The check is case-insensitive.

## Max Wallet Limit

The launchpad enforces a **max wallet holding** limit (currently 3% of total supply). A single wallet cannot hold more than 3% of a token's supply through buys on the bonding curve. This prevents whales from accumulating outsized positions during the early bonding phase.

## Creator Benefits

As the token creator, your token gets visibility on the launchpad and automatic graduation to the AMM. Currently, all trading fees (0.5% buy, 2.5% sell) go to LP reserves. A creator fee share parameter exists on-chain but is set to 0% at this time.
